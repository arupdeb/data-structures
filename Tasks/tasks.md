## Next Tasks
1. create queue with a static array use front and back pointer f:= &arr[0]  b:= &arr[len-1]
given max number of elements in an queue
2. create stacks using static array (with max stack size) and double linked list
3. Binary tree - need to implement a comparator for type check  - BST and add_element(node), delete_element(), search_element(), bench_mark test
4. Add fucntions to contruct a tree from pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal from an array of interface

5. Binary search tree
6. Traversal without a stacka and recursion
